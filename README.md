# .NET Default IoC Tutorial

This is a demo app created for the following blog post in my personal blog:

[https://sahansera.dev/dotnet-core-ioc-container/](https://sahansera.dev/dotnet-core-ioc-container/)

## Intro

The objective of this post is to configure and use Microsoft’s default dependency injection container from scratch to understand how it all hangs together when in action.

We will start with a simple console application, configure an IoC container, and have some fun with it by diving into the .NET Core DI Extensions’ source code.
